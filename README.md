# pos_connect

pos_connect frontend wasn't written to be hosted separately by a frontend webserver. It was written to be hosted together with the backend using Django.
Thus, in order to show the demo, hosted by Github-Page,without the backend app, i create a separate repo here. This repo only contain the demo page from pos_connect code without the backend app
